Hey. I am currently working as a Research fellow at Microsoft Research Lab (MSRI) in Bangalore, India. As a part of the eXtreme Classification group, I am exploring ways of utilising external sources of knowledge in order to make language models more efficient and accurate for the task of retrieval and generation. 

Prior to joining Microsoft Research, I graduated with a B.Tech and an M.S. by research degree in Computer science and engineering from IIIT Hyderabad. During my time at IIIT, I collaborated with the Wikimedia foundation to work on generating factually grounded text for multiple low resource languages by utilising structured data. I also explored the use of NLP techniques to understand music sharing patterns on social media platforms in context of depression. 

Broadly, Iâ€™m interested in using(and improving) language technologies to provide accurate and accessible information to all.
